Can we declare a non-reference function argument const (e.g., void
f(const int);)? What might that mean? Why might we want to do that?
Why donâ€™t people do that often? Try it; write a couple of small programs
to see what works.

//Yes it is possible to declare a non-reference function argument const, it compiles just fine.
//This means that the function can't modify its parameter within the function.
//This would be used mainly to show that the parameter can't be modified.
//People don't use it often because many times, the parameters need to be edited or changed which wouldn't be possible.

// *Testing if i can be changed within the function?*

//No it doesn't work, the compiler says:
//"error: assignment of read-only parameter 'i'
//So the parameter cannot be changed when using const int as a paremeter.




// TEST 2
// Testing if i could be applied to a different value.

//It does compile, so in this case i can be used as a value for different operations as long as i isn't changed within the function


//So what can be seen from these tests is that any attempt to change the parameter is rejected by the compiler,
//but using it as a part of an operation such as int j = (const int i) + 2 works just fine.
